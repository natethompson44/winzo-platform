# WINZO DEVELOPMENT RULES - MIGRATION MODE
# ===============================

# MIGRATION IN PROGRESS
- Currently migrating from vanilla JS/Express to TypeScript/React/tRPC stack
- Follow MIGRATION_PROMPT.md for step-by-step instructions
- These rules are temporarily simplified to avoid conflicts during migration

# GENERAL
- Follow the migration plan in MIGRATION_PROMPT.md exactly
- Do not skip phases or execute out of order
- Preserve all existing functionality during migration
- Maintain Railway (backend) and Netlify (frontend) deployment setup
- Keep all environment variables from .env file

# DATABASE
- Converting from MySQL (reference) to PostgreSQL (current Railway setup)
- Use Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- Preserve all existing data structures
- Test database migrations before deploying

# AUTHENTICATION
- Adapting reference project's OAuth to work with existing JWT system
- Maintain token-based authentication during transition
- Can migrate to cookie-based auth later if desired

# DEPLOYMENT
- Backend: Railway (https://winzo-platform-production-d306.up.railway.app)
- Frontend: Netlify (https://winzo-sports.netlify.app)
- Maintain CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Keep /api/health endpoint for monitoring

# CODE STYLE (Post-Migration)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices
- Use tRPC for type-safe API calls
- Maintain mobile-first, dark-theme UI

# ROLLBACK
- If migration fails, use backup branch: backup-pre-migration
- Keep old code intact until migration is verified successful
- Test thoroughly before removing old files

# NOTES
- These rules will be updated after successful migration
- See MIGRATION_PROMPT.md for complete migration instructions
- All changes should be committed to git for history tracking
