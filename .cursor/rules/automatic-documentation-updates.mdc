# Rule #2: Automatic Documentation Updates (ALWAYS ACTIVE)

MANDATORY: After making ANY code changes, automatically update relevant documentation.

DOCUMENTATION UPDATE REQUIREMENTS:

1. CODE CHANGES → UPDATE DOCS:
   - New components → Update DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md component library
   - API changes → Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md with new endpoints/examples
   - New features → Update USER_GUIDE.md and ADMIN_GUIDE.md as applicable
   - Configuration changes → Update DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md and DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   - Database changes → Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md schema section

2. SPECIFIC UPDATE TRIGGERS:
   - New CSS variables → Add to DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md variables section
   - New React components → Document in DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md with usage examples
   - New API endpoints → Add to API_DOCUMENTATION.md with request/response examples
   - New user features → Update USER_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions
   - New admin features → Update ADMIN_GUIDE.md with management procedures
   - Environment changes → Update DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md configuration sections

3. DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS:
   - Include code examples for all new components/APIs
   - Add screenshots for UI changes (note where needed)
   - Update table of contents and cross-references
   - Maintain consistent formatting and structure
   - Verify all links and references work correctly

4. CROSS-REFERENCE UPDATES:
   - Update docs/INDEX.md if new major sections added
   - Update README.md if core features change
   - Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md if architecture changes
   - Ensure all documentation links remain functional

NEVER make code changes without updating corresponding documentation.
