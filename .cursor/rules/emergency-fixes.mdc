# Rule #5: Emergency Fixes and Hotfixes (USE AS NEEDED)

For urgent production issues, deployment failures, or critical bugs.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTOCOL:
1. Identify root cause quickly using error logs and documentation
2. Implement minimal, targeted fix without breaking existing functionality
3. Test fix thoroughly in development environment
4. Update relevant documentation immediately
5. Deploy with careful monitoring

COMMON EMERGENCY SCENARIOS:
- Netlify build failures (usually ESLint warnings treated as errors)
- API integration issues (check API_DOCUMENTATION.md for correct endpoints)
- Authentication problems (verify JWT configuration and user flow)
- Mobile responsiveness issues (check design system breakpoints)
- Database connection issues (verify environment variables)

HOTFIX STANDARDS:
- Make minimal changes to reduce risk
- Maintain code quality and documentation standards
- Include rollback plan and testing verification
- Update DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with lessons learned
- Schedule proper fix for next development cycle if needed

NEVER compromise long-term code quality for short-term fixes.
