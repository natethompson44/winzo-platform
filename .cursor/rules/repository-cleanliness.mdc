# Rule #3: Repository Cleanliness and Consistency (ALWAYS ACTIVE)

MAINTAIN PRISTINE REPOSITORY STATE:

1. FILE ORGANIZATION:
   - Keep winzo-frontend/src/ organized by feature and component type
   - Maintain clean winzo-backend/src/ structure (routes, models, services, middleware)
   - Store all documentation in docs/ with proper categorization
   - Archive old/temporary files in docs/archive/ rather than deleting

2. CODE CONSISTENCY:
   - Follow established patterns from existing codebase
   - Use CSS variables from design system (never hardcode colors/spacing)
   - Maintain TypeScript interfaces and type safety
   - Follow established naming conventions and file structure
   - Ensure all imports use consistent path patterns

3. QUALITY STANDARDS:
   - Fix ESLint warnings immediately (CI=true treats warnings as errors)
   - Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Ensure responsive design works on all breakpoints
   - Test API integrations and error handling
   - Verify build process completes successfully

4. DOCUMENTATION HYGIENE:
   - Remove outdated or redundant documentation
   - Consolidate duplicate information
   - Maintain accurate cross-references and links
   - Keep code examples current and functional
   - Update version numbers and dates where applicable

5. DEPLOYMENT READINESS:
   - Ensure changes work in both development and production
   - Verify environment variables are properly configured
   - Test build process before committing
   - Maintain compatibility with Netlify/Railway deployment
   - Update deployment documentation for any infrastructure changes

ALWAYS leave the repository in a better state than you found it.
