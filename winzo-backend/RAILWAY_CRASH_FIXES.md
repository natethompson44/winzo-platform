# Railway Server Crash Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **OddsApiService Initialization Blocking Startup**
- **Problem**: OddsApiService was being required at server startup, potentially making API calls that could hang
- **Fix**: Removed OddsApiService initialization from server startup
- **File**: `src/server.js`

### 2. **Database Connection Pool Settings Too Aggressive**
- **Problem**: Connection pool settings were too aggressive for Railway's environment
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced max pool connections from 5 to 3
  - Increased acquire timeout from 30s to 60s
  - Increased idle timeout from 10s to 30s
  - Added connection timeout settings
- **File**: `config/database.js`

### 3. **Health Check Endpoint Hanging**
- **Problem**: Health check was waiting for database connection, causing timeouts
- **Fix**: 
  - Made health check respond immediately
  - Added separate simple health check endpoint
  - Better status reporting for different database states
- **File**: `src/server.js`

### 4. **Startup Timeouts Too Long**
- **Problem**: 10-minute startup timeout was too long for Railway
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced overall timeout to 5 minutes
  - Reduced migration timeout to 2 minutes
  - Created simple startup script with 3-minute timeout
- **Files**: `railway-start.js`, `railway-start-simple.js`

### 5. **Missing Environment Validation**
- **Problem**: Server could hang if critical environment variables were missing
- **Fix**: Added environment variable validation at startup
- **File**: `src/server.js`

### 6. **OddsApiService Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Missing API key could cause startup failures
- **Fix**: Made API key optional with graceful degradation
- **File**: `src/services/oddsApiService.js`

## New Startup Scripts

### `railway-start-simple.js`
- Simplified startup without complex migrations
- 3-minute timeout
- Immediate server start
- Used as default start script

### `railway-start.js`
- Full startup with migrations
- 5-minute timeout
- For when migrations are needed

## Health Check Endpoints

### `/health`
- Comprehensive health check
- Reports database status
- Returns 503 if database is down

### `/api/health`
- Simple health check
- Always returns 200
- For Railway health checks

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

### Optional
- `ODDS_API_KEY` - For sports data (graceful degradation if missing)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (defaults to 'development')

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Use the simple startup script** for Railway deployment
2. **Set appropriate environment variables** in Railway dashboard
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Use `/api/health`** for Railway health checks

## Testing the Fixes

1. Deploy to Railway with the updated code
2. Monitor startup logs for any timeout messages
3. Check that health checks respond quickly
4. Verify server stays running for extended periods

## Additional Monitoring

Consider adding:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Database connection monitoring
- External API call monitoring
- Memory usage monitoring
