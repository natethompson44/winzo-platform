## üîß Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Hardcoded Betslip Data (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: All users saw the same "Salzburg vs Union Berlin" placeholder bet  
**Solution**: Implemented dynamic bet slip management with BetSlipContext integration  
**Files Modified**: 
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/components/Shared/FooterCard.tsx`

**Impact**: Users now see their actual bet selections instead of placeholder data

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Cross-Sport Data Contamination (CRITICAL)  
**Problem**: Soccer teams appearing in basketball, tennis, and ice hockey sections  
**Solution**: Replaced with sport-appropriate teams and leagues  
**Files Modified**:
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/public/data/tabOne.ts` (Basketball & Ice Hockey data)
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/public/data/tabThree.ts` (Basketball & American Football data)

**Impact**: 
- Basketball: Now shows real NBA and EuroLeague teams
- American Football: Now shows real NFL and NCAA teams  
- Ice Hockey: Fixed team data contamination
- Tennis: Confirmed already had correct tennis player data

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Test Authentication Data (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Public exposure of test credentials and invite codes  
**Solution**: Removed all test accounts and hardcoded credentials  
**Files Modified**:
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/components/Pages/CreateAcount/CreateAcount.tsx`
- `winzo-backend/src/database/schema.sql`
- `winzo-backend/tests/comprehensive-api.test.js`
- `docs/README.md`

**Files Deleted**:
- `winzo-backend/src/database/create-test-user.js`

**Impact**: Eliminated security vulnerabilities and test account exposure

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Performance Issues (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: 6.4% cache hit rate, 44 duplicate image requests, logo spam  
**Solution**: Implemented enhanced image caching system  
**Files Modified**:
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/utils/imageCache.ts` (Complete rewrite)

**Impact**: 
- Eliminated duplicate image requests
- Implemented 30-minute cache with TTL
- Added request deduplication
- Smart fallback system for failed images

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Placeholder Images (HIGH)
**Problem**: Promotional and authentication page placeholder images  
**Solution**: Replaced with branded content and professional layouts  
**Files Modified**:
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/components/Pages/Promotions/Promotions.tsx`
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/components/Pages/Login/Login.tsx`  
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/components/Pages/CreateAcount/CreateAcount.tsx`

**Impact**: Professional branded experience instead of placeholder content

### ‚úÖ Issue #6: Mock Data Cleanup (HIGH)
**Problem**: Unused mock data files and development artifacts  
**Solution**: Cleaned up development-only files and routes  
**Files Modified**:
- `winzo-backend/src/routes/user.js` (Cleaned mock sessions)
- `oddsx/oddsx-react/public/data/allPageData.ts` (Updated promotion data)

**Files Deleted**:

- `winzo-backend/tests/direct-registration-test.js`

**Impact**: Cleaner codebase without development artifacts

### ‚úÖ Issue #7: Template Cleanup (HIGH)  
**Problem**: Generic template text and branding
