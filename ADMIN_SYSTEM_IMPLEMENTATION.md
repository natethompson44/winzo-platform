- **Secure Routes**: All admin endpoints require admin authentication

### 2. Admin Backend APIs (`/api/admin/`)
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Platform overview statistics
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User management with pagination, search, and filters
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id` - Update user details (balance, status, role)
- `GET /api/admin/bets` - Comprehensive bet management
- `PUT /api/admin/bets/:id` - Manual bet settlement
