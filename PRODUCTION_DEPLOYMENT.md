# WINZO Platform Production Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Current Deployment Flow

Your WINZO Platform uses an **automated deployment flow**:

```
Push to main branch → GitHub Actions CI/CD → Netlify (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)
```

### ✅ How It Works
1. **Push to main branch** triggers GitHub Actions
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** runs quality checks (lint, type-check, build, security)
3. **Netlify** automatically deploys frontend from the build
4. **Railway** automatically deploys backend from the code
5. **Quality Gate** ensures everything is production-ready

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Simply push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** Your existing Netlify + Railway setup will handle the deployment automatically.

### Manual Quality Checks (Optional)
```bash
# Windows
.\deploy-production.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./deploy-production.sh
```

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your production services:

#### Netlify (Frontend)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.com
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### Railway (Backend)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
API_SPORTS_KEY=your-api-sports-key
```

### GitHub Actions Secrets (Optional)
Only needed if you want enhanced CI/CD features:
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: For Railway API access
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: For Netlify API access

---

## 🔄 Deployment Process

### 1. Code Push
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD
The pipeline automatically runs:
- ✅ **Frontend**: Lint, type-check, build
- ✅ **Backend**: Lint, security audit
- ✅ **Security**: Vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Quality Gate**: Final verification

### 3. Automatic Deployment
- **Netlify**: Detects changes and deploys frontend
- **Railway**: Detects changes and deploys backend

### 4. Verification
- Health checks run automatically
- Build artifacts are verified
- Quality gate ensures production readiness

---

## 🎯 Deployment Targets

### Frontend: Netlify
- **Trigger**: Git push to main branch
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `build/`
- **Environment**: Production optimizations enabled

### Backend: Railway
- **Trigger**: Git push to main branch
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Environment**: Production with database migrations
- **Health Check**: `npm run healthcheck`

---

## 🔧 Production Optimizations

### Frontend (Netlify)
- ✅ Source maps disabled for security
- ✅ Production build optimizations
- ✅ Bundle size optimization (~150KB gzipped)
- ✅ Tree shaking and minification
- ✅ CDN delivery via Netlify

### Backend (Railway)
- ✅ Production environment configuration
- ✅ Database connection pooling
- ✅ Security headers (Helmet)
- ✅ Rate limiting and CORS
- ✅ Compression middleware
- ✅ Auto-scaling via Railway

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Implemented
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ SQL injection protection (Sequelize)

### CI/CD Security
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Security dependency audits
- ✅ Build-time security checks
- ✅ Quality gates prevent insecure deployments

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Frontend (Netlify)
- **Bundle Size**: ~150KB gzipped
- **Loading Strategy**: Code splitting
- **Caching**: Static assets with cache busting
- **CDN**: Global edge network
- **PWA**: Service worker for offline support

### Backend (Railway)
- **Database**: Connection pooling
- **Caching**: Redis for API responses
- **Compression**: Gzip compression
- **Auto-scaling**: Railway handles scaling

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Automated Health Checks
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/status` - API status
- `GET /api/health` - Detailed health info

### CI/CD Monitoring
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions status
# Visit: https://github.com/your-repo/actions

# Check Netlify deployment
# Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site

# Check Railway deployment
# Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions logs
# Clear cache and rebuild locally
cd winzo-frontend
npm run clean
npm ci
npm run build
```

#### Deployment Issues
1. **Check GitHub Actions** - Look for CI/CD failures
2. **Verify Netlify** - Check build logs and environment variables
3. **Check Railway** - Verify deployment logs and environment variables
4. **Database Issues** - Run migrations manually if needed

### Logs & Debugging
- **Frontend**: Netlify function logs and build logs
- **Backend**: Railway application logs
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow logs

---

## 📈 Post-Deployment

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Health checks pass
2. ✅ API endpoints respond
3. ✅ Frontend loads correctly
4. ✅ Database migrations complete
5. ✅ Authentication works
6. ✅ Payment processing (if applicable)

### Monitoring Setup
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Set up alerts for downtime
- **Error Tracking**: Configure Sentry for error monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals
- **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for security incidents

---

## 🔄 Maintenance
