# WINZO Platform Complete Overhaul Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive roadmap provides everything needed to transform your WINZO sports betting platform from its current inconsistent state into a modern, professional, and maintainable application. The solution addresses your core frustrations with Cursor AI's inconsistency by establishing a systematic approach using proven design patterns and a clean slate migration strategy.

## The Problem You're Facing

### Current Challenges
- **Cursor AI Inconsistency**: Partial implementations that don't apply site-wide
- **Technical Debt Spiral**: Multiple iterations creating unmaintainable complexity
- **Design Inconsistencies**: Mixed patterns, sizing issues, spacing problems
