## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Consolidation**: Information was merged into comprehensive guides
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple files covered the same topics
3. **Outdated**: Some information was superseded by newer implementations
4. **Organization**: Cleaner documentation structure for users
