# MIME Type Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Problem Description
The landing page was blank due to MIME type errors where CSS and JS files were returning HTML instead of their actual content:

```
Refused to apply style from 'main.49923e50.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type
Refused to execute script from 'main.1e3e54f7.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a catch-all redirect in `netlify.toml` that redirected ALL requests (`/*`) to `/index.html`, including requests for static assets like CSS and JS files. This caused Netlify to serve the HTML content instead of the actual CSS/JS files.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Added specific redirects for static assets before the catch-all redirect
- Added proper MIME type headers for CSS, JS, and JSON files
- Ensured static assets are served with correct content types

### 2. Created `_redirects` file
- Added a backup `_redirects` file in the `winzo-frontend/public` directory
- Provides additional protection against MIME type issues

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Redirect Order (Most Important)
```toml
# Static assets first (highest priority)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/static/*"
  to = "/static/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

# Other specific files
[[redirects]]
  from = "/asset-manifest.json"
  to = "/asset-manifest.json"
  status = 200
  force = true

# Catch-all last (lowest priority)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### MIME Type Headers
```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/static/css/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/css"

[[headers]]
  for = "/static/js/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript"
```

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# For Linux/Mac
chmod +x rebuild-and-deploy.sh
./rebuild-and-deploy.sh

# For Windows PowerShell
.\rebuild-and-deploy.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cd winzo-frontend
   rm -rf build/ node_modules/
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix MIME type issues for static assets"
   git push
   ```

3. **Trigger Netlify deployment:**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment from the latest commit
   - Or push to your main branch to trigger automatic deployment

## Verification

After deployment, verify the fix by:

1. **Check browser console** - No more MIME type errors
2. **Inspect network tab** - CSS and JS files should have correct content types:
   - CSS files: `text/css`
   - JS files: `application/javascript`
3. **Page should load properly** - No blank page

## Files Modified

1. `netlify.toml` - Updated redirects and headers
2. `winzo-frontend/public/_redirects` - Added backup redirects
3. `rebuild-and-deploy.sh` - Build script for Linux/Mac
4. `rebuild-and-deploy.ps1` - Build script for Windows

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Redirect Priority**: Static asset redirects are processed before the catch-all redirect
2. **Force Flag**: The `force = true` flag ensures these redirects take precedence
3. **Explicit MIME Types**: Headers explicitly set the correct content types
4. **Backup Protection**: The `_redirects` file provides additional protection

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
- Always put specific redirects before catch-all redirects
- Use explicit MIME type headers for static assets
- Test deployments in a staging environment first
- Monitor browser console for MIME type errors

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:
1. Clear Netlify cache in the dashboard
2. Check if the build is generating static assets correctly
3. Verify the redirect order in `netlify.toml`
4. Check browser developer tools for any remaining MIME type errors
