# Netlify TypeScript Fix - React Types Issue

## 🚨 **The Problem**

Netlify build was failing with TypeScript error `TS7016`:
```
Could not find a declaration file for module 'react'
```

This happened because:
1. React type definitions were in `devDependencies`
2. Netlify wasn't installing devDependencies properly
3. TypeScript couldn't find the React type declarations

## ✅ **The Solution**

### 1. **Updated Netlify Configuration**
```toml
[build]
  base = "winzo-frontend"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"  # Added explicit npm install
  publish = "build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"
  NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"  # Ensures devDependencies are installed
```

### 2. **Moved React Types to Dependencies**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.3.23",      // Moved from devDependencies
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.7",   // Moved from devDependencies
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **What This Fixes**

1. **Explicit Installation**: `npm install && npm run build` ensures all dependencies are installed
2. **Production Flag**: `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"` forces installation of devDependencies
3. **Type Availability**: React types are now in regular dependencies, always available
4. **Build Success**: TypeScript can now find React type declarations

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

- ✅ Netlify build should now succeed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation will work properly
- ✅ React types will be available during build
- ✅ Production deployment will work correctly

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. **`netlify.toml`** - Updated build command and environment variables
2. **`winzo-frontend/package.json`** - Moved React types to dependencies

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and Push** these changes
2. **Netlify will redeploy** automatically
3. **Build should succeed** without TypeScript errors
4. **Verify deployment** works correctly

The TypeScript/React types issue should now be resolved! 🎉
