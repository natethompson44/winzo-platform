# 01 Project Vision

## Purpose
This document defines the overall architectural vision for the Winzo front-end, emphasizing modularity, reusability, and maintainability to support a scalable sports betting platform.

## Technology Stack
- HTML5 for semantic structure.
- CSS3 for styling, including Flexbox and Grid for layouts.
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no frameworks like React/Vue/Angular at this stage to keep it lightweight and foundational; frameworks can be integrated later if needed).

## Design Principles
- Mobile-first: Styles start with small screens and scale up using media queries.
- Responsive: Adapt to various devices with fluid layouts and breakpoints (e.g., 768px for tablets, 1024px for desktops).
- Clean UI: Minimalist design with ample whitespace for readability.
- Intuitive UX: Logical navigation and clear calls-to-action to guide users through betting flows.

## Modularity
Components like buttons, cards, and navigation will be designed as reusable CSS classes. For example:
- Buttons: Classes like `.btn-primary` for easy application across pages.
- Navigation: A single nav component adaptable for desktop/mobile.
This allows dropping components into any page without duplication.

## Scalability
The structure uses a template-based approach (e.g., sport_template.html) that can be duplicated for new sports. Global CSS variables ensure consistent updates. Layout grids support adding features like live updates or additional data sources without refactoring core structure.

## Future Integration
Backend integration will involve JavaScript fetching data from APIs (e.g., via `fetch()`) and rendering it into placeholders. For example, event listings will replace dummy data with dynamic content, maintaining the rigid layout for consistency.
