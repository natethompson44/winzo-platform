# 05 Sports Page Vision

## Purpose
This document details the structure and presentation of sports betting data for Winzo, focusing on a consistent template.

## Data Presentation
Events are listed in a grid: date/time left, teams with logos centered, odds right. Odds broken into spread, total, moneyline for clarity.

## Consistency
Uniform grid columns ensure predictable placement (e.g., odds always in last column). Same structure for all sports.

## Placeholders
Use dummy text/images (e.g., "Team A", placeholder.png). These will be replaced by API data via JS, slotting into existing elements without layout shifts.

## Scalability for Sports
Template is sport-agnostic; change title/logo and duplicate for new sports (e.g., Basketball). Grid adapts to varying data lengths.

## Visual Hierarchy
Odds in bold/accent colors to stand out. Teams larger font than dates. Borders separate events for scannability.
