# 03 Components Vision

## Purpose
This document details the design and functionality of core UI components for Winzo, ensuring reusability and consistency.

## Button States
- Normal: Base background and text color.
- Hover: Darken background by 10% for feedback.
- Active/Focus: Add box-shadow for accessibility.
- Disabled: Reduced opacity, no cursor interaction.

## Button Sizes & Variations
- Sizes: Small (0.875rem font), Medium (default 1rem), Large (1.25rem).
- Variations: Solid (filled background), Outline (border only) for flexibility in CTAs vs. secondary actions.

## Form Element Consistency
Input fields use full-width with rounded borders. Labels are bold and block-level. Error messages in red below inputs. Uniform padding and focus states ensure a cohesive feel.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Focus states: Visible outlines/box-shadows.
- Contrast ratios: Ensure text/background meet WCAG AA (e.g., 4.5:1).
- ARIA attributes: Add as needed in JS for dynamic forms.
